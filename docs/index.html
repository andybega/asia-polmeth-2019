# Project goal

.middle[
&gt;The HFC program is developing and testing hybrid geopolitical forecasting systems. These systems **integrate human and machine forecasting components** to create maximally accurate, flexible, and scalable forecasting capabilities.
]

.right.small[From https://www.hybridforecasting.com]

The idea is to overcome some of the respective weaknesses of human and machine-generated forecasts by combining them in some to be determined fashion.

???

Human-generated forecasts are flexible, but subject to cognitive biases and scalability issues.

Machine-generated forecasts are reliable and scalable, but ill-suited for idiosyncratic or emerging issues.

# Scoring

Multinomial Brier score:

`$$mBS = \sum_{i=1}^R(f_i - o_i)^2$$`

- `\(R\)` is the number of answer options, `\(f\)` the vector of weights summing to 1, and `\(o\)` a 0/1 vector marking the correct option
- ranges from 0 (good) to 2 (bad)

--

Ordered Brier score: 

1. Split the ordinal categories (A-B-C-D) into cumulative binary pairs, aggregating the forecast probabilities for each grouping of categories (A-BCD; AB-CD; ABC-D). 
2. Calculate the multinomial Brier score for each of the binary categories.
3. Average across the binary category scores to obtain the final Brier score. 

- also ranges from 0 to 2
- "near misses" are penalized less than far misses

# The hybrid part:

# Some users could see time series charts and/or machine forecasts for some IFPs


---

# How this works

- An automated system is collecting and updating data from several data sources, and matching them up, if possible, to questions

--

If data for a particular question is available:

- Chart the data
- An automated system generates a machine forecast

### How much crude oil will Iraq produce in May 2018?

- Less than 4,280 *(38%)*
- Between 4,280 and 4,384, inclusive *(15%)*
- More than 4,384 but less than 4,473 *(13%)*

The model is ARIMA(0, 1, 1)

# basil-ts

Automated time series forecaster microservice

Implemented in R + Python Flask + RESTful API

Sketch of the internals: 

1. Parse incoming question and data
2. Produce a time series forecast using an automated ARIMA fitter&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
3. Convert the time series forecast to answer option probabilities

Most of the complexity is related to automating the question/task parsing and handling edge cases.

???

Examples of parsing that needs to be done:

- how far ahead to forecast, which requires parsing the data and question time periods
- whether the data are count and should be constrained
- partial data handling
- data aggregation for fixed period questions

---

# Questions that were of primary concern to us

--

How well are the machine forecasts doing?

--

Are there particular question groups where performance is good or lacking? Basically, where do we need to focus improvements?

# Let's start looking at data and results

---

# Data

RCT-A, the first trial period, lasted from 7 March to 7 September 2018

- Use subset of forecasts from 2 May (turkers enter) to 1 August 2018 (change in tracking)

~49,000 forecasts

156 IFPs; 46 with machine forecasts

971 unique users

Forecasters: 

- Volunteers who joined the platform 
- Amazon Mechanical Turkers
- Machine (basil-ts)

---

# Summary of some findings in the paper

--

Volunteers are better forecasts than Amazon Turkers

Machines are somewhere in the middle

--

Human forecasters who saw the machine forecasts did poorly; volunteer forecasts who saw only charts had overall the best performance

--

It's not clear why though, e.g.:

--

- they outperformed on questions that did not have data (charts and model)

--

- they outperformed volunteer forecasters who saw the machine forecasts even when the machine forecasts had good accuracy

--

Relative performance: where did the machine forecasts do better than human forecasters?

---

# Relative forecaster performance

--

Group questions by data source, N=14 groups

--

Linear model to compare average Brier scores of volunteer, turker, and machine forecasts (reference category)

`$$\textrm{Brier}_{ij} = \beta_{i}\textrm{DataSource}_i + \beta'_{ij}(\textrm{DataSource}_i\times\textrm{Forecaster}_j)$$`

--

`\(\beta_i\)` = average Brier score for machine forecasts for question group `\(i\)`

--

`\(\beta'_{ij}\)` = average Brier score *relative to machine forecasts* for forecaster group `\(j\)` in question group `\(i\)`

--

- Negative values `\(\rightarrow\)` human forecasters did better

--

- Positive values `\(\rightarrow\)` machine forecasts did better

???

- explain the two panels
- x-axis left is average machine forecast performance, right is difference from left; both are Brier scores
- y-axis are question groups, number is number of questions
- sorted so that at top are better human, at bottom are better machine

---
class: center, middle

![](img/model-machine-by-data-source.png)

???

- overall easiest, which can't see directly were oil prices, stocks
- overall hardest were ACLED, OECD interest rates, and Boko Haram
- humans generally tended to do better on questions with monthly period (food prices, oil production)
- machines more clearly did better on questions that require data aggregation (ACLED, Nigeria, hacking); earthquakes aggregates are readily available
- ACLED 2op versus 5op: maybe partly 0's, partly truncation issue

---

# ACLED 5-option

Overall hard questions; machine outperformed human forecasts

&gt; How many battle deaths will ACLED record in Central African Republic in August 2018?

![](img/chart-2117.png)


---

# OECD interest rates

Overall hard questions; machine has middling performance

&gt; What will be the long-term interest rate for Hungary (HUN) in July 2018?

![](img/chart-1793.png)


---

# ACLED binary question

Relatively easy questions, but machines underperformed a lot

&gt; Will ACLED record any riot/protest events in Gambia in July 2018?

![](img/chart-1136.png)

---

# Conclusions

Machine forecasts did well on count questions that require data aggregation 

- ACLED
- Privacyrights hacking
- Nigeria security tracker (Boko Haram)

--

Some of the overall hardest questions, and where to some extent human forecasters did better, are economic/financial monthly series 

- OECD interest rates
- FAO food price indices
- exchange rates
- oil production

--

---

# Issues we did not address

--

What about selection issues; are volunteer forecasters able to self-select into questions they will do well on?

--

Do the chart volunteers do better on questions requiring data aggregation; generally there are some inconsistencies on why/how the chart volunteers did so well.

# Preview

.left.large[I'm going to show results of an exploratory analysis of the relative accuracy of volunteer, Amazon Mechanical Turker, and automated machine forecasts for a broad set of questions (IFPs)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the HFC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; during the first trial period (RCT-A&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) that took place this year.]

# Project goal

&gt;The HFC program is developing and testing hybrid geopolitical forecasting systems. These systems **integrate human and machine forecasting components** to create maximally accurate, flexible, and scalable forecasting capabilities.

.right.small[From https://www.hybridforecasting.com]

The idea is to overcome some of the respective weaknesses of human and machine-generated forecasts by combining them in some to be determined fashion.

Human-generated forecasts are flexible, but subject to cognitive biases and scalability issues.

Machine-generated forecasts are reliable and scalable, but ill-suited for idiosyncratic or emerging issues.

# Scoring

Multinomial Brier score:

`$$mBS = \sum_{i=1}^R(f_i - o_i)^2$$`

- `\(R\)` is the number of answer options, `\(f\)` the vector of weights summing to 1, and `\(o\)` a 0/1 vector marking the correct option
- ranges from 0 (good) to 2 (bad)

--

Ordered Brier score: 

1. Split the ordinal categories (A-B-C-D) into cumulative binary pairs, aggregating the forecast probabilities for each grouping of categories (A-BCD; AB-CD; ABC-D). 
2. Calculate the multinomial Brier score for each of the binary categories.
3. Average across the binary category scores to obtain the final Brier score. 

- also ranges from 0 to 2
- "near misses" are penalized less than far misses

# The Hybrid part:

# Some users could see time series charts and machine forecasts for some IFPs


---

# How this works

- An automated system is collection and updating data from several data sources
- An automated system identifies if data for a particular question is available

If so:

- Chart the data
- An automated system generates a machine forecast

# basil-ts

Automated time series forecaster microservice

Implemented in R + Python Flask + RESTful API

Sketch of the internals: 

1. Parse incoming question and data
2. Produce a time series forecast using an automated ARIMA fitter&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
3. Convert the time series forecast to answer option probabilities

Most of the complexity is related to automating the question/task parsing and handling edge cases.

# Let's start looking at data and results

---

# Data

- RCT-A, the first trial period, lasted from 7 March to 7 September 2018
- Use subset of forecasts from 2 May to 1 August 2018

N fcasts, n IFPs

# Summary of some findings in the paper

Volunteers are better forecasts than Amazon Turkers

Machines are somewhere in the middle

Human forecasters who saw the machine forecasts did poorly; volunteer forecasts who saw only charts had overall the best performance

It's not clear why though, e.g.:
- they outperformed on questions that did not have data (charts and model)
- they outperformed volunteer forecasters who saw the machine forecasts even when the machine forecasts had good accuracy

Relative performance: where did the machine forecasts do better than human forecasters?

# Model overview

Group questions by data source, N=14 groups

Compare average Brier scores of volunteer, turker, and machine forecasts (reference category)

`$$\textrm{Brier}_{ij} = \beta_{i}\textrm{DataSource}_i + \beta'_{ij}(\textrm{DataSource}_i\times\textrm{Forecaster}_j)$$`

`\(\beta_i\)` = average Brier score for machine forecasts for question group `\(i\)`

`\(\beta'_{ij}\)` = average Brier score *relative to machine forecasts* for forecaster group `\(j\)` in question group `\(i\)`

- Negative values `\(\rightarrow\)` human forecasters did better
- Positive values `\(\rightarrow\)` machine forecasts did better

# ACLED 5-option


---

# OECD interest rates


---

# ACLED binary question


---

# Conclusions

Machine forecasts did well on count questions that require data aggregation 

Some of the overall hardest questions, and where to some extent human forecasters did better, are economic/financial monthly series 

- OECD interest rates
- FAO food price indices

# Hybrid Forecasting Competition (HFC)

---

# Project goal

>The HFC program is developing and testing hybrid geopolitical forecasting systems. These systems integrate human and machine forecasting components to create maximally accurate, flexible, and scalable forecasting capabilities.
>
>Human-generated forecasts may be subject to cognitive biases and/or scalability limits. Machine-generated (i.e., statistical, computational) forecasting approaches may be more scalable and data-driven, but are often ill-suited to render forecasts for idiosyncratic or newly emerging geopolitical issues. Hybrid approaches hold promise for combining the strengths of these two approaches while mitigating their individual weaknesses.
>
>Performers are developing systems that integrate human and machine forecasting contributions in novel ways. These systems are competing in a multi-year competition to identify approaches that may enable the Intelligence Community (IC) to radically improve the accuracy and timeliness of geopolitical forecasts.

# Scoring

Multinomial Brier score:

$$mBS = \sum_{i=1}^R(f_i - o_i)^2$$

- $R$ is the number of answer options, $f$ the vector of weights summing to 1, and $o$ a 0/1 vector marking the correct option
- ranges from 0 (good) to 2 (bad)

--

Ordered Brier score: 

1. Split the ordinal categories (A-B-C-D) into cumulative binary pairs, aggregating the forecast probabilities for each grouping of categories (A-BCD; AB-CD; ABC-D). 
2. Calculate the multinomial Brier score for each of the binary categories.
3. Average across the binary category scores to obtain the final Brier score. 

- also ranges from 0 to 2
- "near misses" are penalized less than far misses

# The Hybrid part:

# Some users could see time series charts and machine forecasts for some IFPs


---

# How this works

- dig


---

# Data

- RCT-A, the first trial period, lasted from 7 March to 7 September 2018
- Use subset of forecasts from 2 May to 1 August 2018

N fcasts, n IFPs

# Summary of some findings in the paper

Volunteers are better forecasts than Amazon Turkers

Machines are somewhere in the middle

Human forecasters who saw the machine forecasts did poorly; volunteer forecasts who saw only charts had overall the best performance

It's not clear why though, e.g.:
- they outperformed on questions that did not have data (charts and model)
- they outperformed volunteer forecasters who saw the machine forecasts even when the machine forecasts had good accuracy

Relative performance: where did the machine forecasts do better than human forecasters?

# ACLED 5-option


---

# OECD interest rates


---

# ACLED binary question


---

Machine forecasts did well on count questions that require data aggregation 

Some of the overall hardest questions, and where to some extent human forecasters did better, are economic/financial monthly series 

- OECD interest rates
- FAO food price indices
